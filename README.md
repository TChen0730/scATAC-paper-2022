The raw scATAC-seq datasets in the FASTQ format with filtered peak/barcode matrix have been uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database: GSE175694. 

This repository provides the code for (1) generating and processing state-by-barcode matrix to evaluate global epigenetic alterations, and (2) chromatin state enrichment analysis we performed in the paper.
